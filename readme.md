## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

The project involves creating a Header and Footer Display Website with distinct designs using pure HTML and CSS. The purpose of the project is to showcase different static and animated versions of headers and footers in a well-structured website. The key components of the project include designing unique and engaging themes for the landing page, implementing various header and footer styles, and ensuring proper deployment and README file updates.The technology used in this project is pure HTML and CSS. The project strictly follows a technology stack of HTML and CSS only, with no direct addition of CSS codes in HTML files. External CSS files are used for styling, and the file structure is maintained with appropriate naming conventions, such as using lower-kebab-case for file names and organizing subfolders like header-gallery and footer-gallery based on content or functionality.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
